* TODO (random priority, not in this order)
	* [ ] cli help / nicer arguments
    * [ ] structs/classes
    * [ ] modularisation / code file/library import (like rust crating)

    * [ ] Compiled version
    * [ ] "extern"ing like in rust for calling rust-std methods
      - [ ] Syntax: `extern "rustc"` something like that maybe that
        would look cool idk
